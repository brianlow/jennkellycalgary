		We couldn't be happier with our decision to hire Jenn for our cleaning services. She is so friendly and honest. Jenn has been coming to our home for over a year on a bi-weekly basis. Her cleans are exactly what we were looking for. She was able to customize our bi-weekly cleans since we have a dog (and the dog hair can get out of hand). Jenn is always reliable and organized. After our first meeting she suggested using safe floor products for my dog, which we really appreciated. We have hired other cleaning ladies before Jenn through big companies, but Jenn's personalized and thorough cleans really set her apart from the rest. I would definitely recommend Jenn to anyone looking for a trustworthy, thoughtful and diligent cleaning service.

		I have used Jennifer Kelly’s services since the spring of 2009. I first engaged her services for dog walking my boxer dog. She continued to walk my dog (and subsequent dogs) daily for 3 years. In late 2009, I also began using Jennifer’s services to clean our condo weekly and this continued until we moved into our new home in late 2011. After cleaning our house ourselves for 3 years, we realized how much time and energy we were missing out on spending with each other and I have since had Jennifer clean our house since the fall of 2014. Her reliability, high standards and flexibility combined with extremely reasonable rates make her invaluable to my husband and I and have greatly increased our quality of life. My dogs love her and there is nothing more satisfying than coming home to happy pets and a wonderfully clean home. I highly recommend Jennifer Kelly.
