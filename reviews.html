		We couldn't be happier with our decision to hire Jenn for our cleaning services. She is so friendly and honest. Jenn has been coming to our home for over a year on a bi-weekly basis. Her cleans are exactly what we were looking for. She was able to customize our bi-weekly cleans since we have a dog (and the dog hair can get out of hand). Jenn is always reliable and organized. After our first meeting she suggested using safe floor products for my dog, which we really appreciated. We have hired other cleaning ladies before Jenn through big companies, but Jenn's personalized and thorough cleans really set her apart from the rest. I would definitely recommend Jenn to anyone looking for a trustworthy, thoughtful and diligent cleaning service.

		I can honestly say she will not let you down, we are delighted by her standards,attention to detail & cleanliness , even my 5 year old says "she's AWESOME!!"
		I love how I don't have to put/move anything back into place when I get home...everything is just as I left it and clean!!! I would without hesitation recommend Jenn!!!
